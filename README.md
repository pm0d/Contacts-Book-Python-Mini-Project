# Contacts-Book-Python-Mini-Project

##### Project Description: 

Develop a contact book application in Python. The application should include the following:

1. It should allow users to create, store and manage information about their contacts such as name, phone number, email, address, etc.
2. To store contacts, a dictionary data structure in python can be used to store each contact as a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the contact, and the value is an object of a custom class that contains the contact details.
3. The methods in the class should allow users to perform basic operations such as updating, deleting, or displaying the contact information.
4. Your program can use a loop logic to seek user input and perform different actions based on their input choices such as
   * Add a new contact
   * Search for an existing contact
   * Edit the existing contact
   * Delete a contact
   * Exit the program

#### Extra Points

5. The contact book should be saved into a pickle file when you exit the program, this will help you restore the contact book the next time you run your program.
6. Every time when application starts, it should restore your existing contact book if there is one.



#### Points will be allotted based on the following aspects :
* Modularity in application code
* Design and Structure
* Usage of concepts
* Timely submission
* No need of GUI
